        of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks
        up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most
        popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately,
        John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old — read all about his life
        and legacy here.
