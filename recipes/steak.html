    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        A great flank steak marinade like this one is important if you want a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. Make sure
        you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time. This wonderful
        quick and easy recipe also works great when the steak is sliced and used for fajitas.
        Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut
        that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared
        to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.
